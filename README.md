SOUTH CENTRAL RAILWAY DATA BASE PROJECT:

Project Description:

The South Central Railway Database Project is a relational database management system developed using MySQL to manage railway operations efficiently.
The system organizes and connects important railway data such as districts, stations, departments, employees, trains, schedules, tickets, and complaints into structured tables.

It helps railway authorities to:

Manage staff and departments
Track train schedules
Handle passenger bookings
Record and resolve complaints
Generate reports easily
Overall, the project improves data accuracy, avoids duplication, and supports better decision-making.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

MySQL – Database management system
SQL – For writing queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN)
MySQL Workbench / XAMPP – To design and manage database
ER Diagram – To design relationships between tables

HOW IT WORKS:

The system contains 10 interconnected tables (districts, stations, employees, trains, tickets, complaints, etc.).
Each table has a Primary Key to uniquely identify records.
Foreign Keys are used to connect related tables (for example, stations linked to districts).
Data is inserted into tables using SQL commands.
Queries are executed to:
Retrieve train details
Check employee information
View ticket bookings
Track complaints
Using JOIN operations, data from multiple tables can be combined for reports and analysis.
